V1.4
1) fixes issue when current trophy equals max trophy in GUI
2) Fix issue when OOS happens during or immediately after trophy drop. Problem here is village trophy value is not updated due OOS skipping village report to update trophy value. 
3) Add Check box in advanced tab to attack if loot < X % (at your choice but less 20%)

For 1) and 2), thanls to monkeyhunter: https://mybot.run/forums/thread-13107-post-113833.html#pid113833

V1.3
1) add function to check when TH fall in TH snipe: if loots < 10% of total loots possible then => attack like dead base (like greedy mode). TH have 20% of global ressources il you take only 10% then it's dead base too ;)
